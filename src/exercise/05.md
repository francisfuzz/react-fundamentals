# Styling

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/05.md`

- When I first opened the file, I was looking for the `.html` extension for `05.html`, but noticed that I only have `05.js`. This illustrates how powerful React is just by itself: you can literally write the JavaScript out and have the library build out the elements for you, in addition to importing the CSS for calling ease. 🤯
- Styling is... weird. 😅 I'm getting tripped up between the way you can interpolates classes and in-line styles at the same time. My old habits say to put everything in classes and in-line styles are icky, but I wonder what the different ways of styling in React are?
- In the first extra credit exercise, I learned that we can custom React components are really just functions that return the appropriate JSX. It was really neat how we can leverage a function's arguments to compose an element, making for a more "declarative" style of what's on screen.
- The last extra credit asks us to modify the API of the Box component to accept a `size`. It's great that we remove the "mental lifting" of knowing which class to specified and have a more declarative way of specifying size. But, let's say someone wanted to created a `Box` and they don't use the `size`. I created an iteration where the component defaults to the `small` size as a way of helping them. However, thinking about its API, what if someone wanted to create a custom box size? I changed my implementation to default the sizeClass to `null` than falling back on `undefined` should an unsupported size is specified. In this way, we only let the client choose how they want to style the box rather than making that decision for them.
- Gregor [reviewed my Box implementation](https://github.com/francisfuzz/react-fundamentals/pull/5#discussion_r735166224) and I laerned a ton.
  - Update the component's interface so it is flexible to receive additional input(s) from consumers.
  - In Gregor's implementation, setting a `size` that may not have a class equivalent (like, "mega") will produce a non-empty `sizeClassName` (so, `box--mega`). The rendered component will show a `Box` component with that class  which respects what the consumer wants, but they will need to update the CSS themselves to define what `box--mega` will actually look like.
  - Okay, so [this](https://github.com/gr2m/react-fundamentals/pull/11/files#diff-bebfa65f4691060e69138a28974695f2bd9c4a41bc73cb081691017b656f7fa6R72-R80) is _beautifully_ expressive. Filtering an array using `.filter(Boolean)` passes each item in the array to the `Boolean()` object, and the `Boolean()` object coerces each item to `true` or `false` depending on whether it's truthy or falsy, and if the item is truthy, we keep it such that the returned array includes it ([source explanation](https://michaeluloth.com/filter-boolean)).

### Questions 🤔

#### When creating a custom component, is there a better or more idiomatic way to combine styles than using `Object.assign()`?

Use the spread operator:

```js
const moreStyles = { backgroundColor: 'yellow' }
const allStyles = { fontStyle: 'italic', ...moreStyles }
```

#### How does React know how to build the elements on the page by just specifying JS alone? Is a possible hint in the way that we export a default function that returns a bunch of React components?

When we run `npm start`, NPM checks `package.json`, finds `scripts.start` and execute what's there:

```json
react-scripts start
```

[`react-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). `react-scripts`' documentation for [Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) doesn't go into the technical specifics, but I will. 😉

Looking at [its `package.json`'s `scripts.start` line](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/9d0369b1fe3260e620b08effcf85f1edefc5d1ea/package.json#L14), it runs this:

```
cd packages/react-scripts && node bin/react-scripts.js start
```

The [`bin/react-scripts.js`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js)

The [only dependency it imports](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/9d0369b1fe3260e620b08effcf85f1edefc5d1ea/packages/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js#L18) is `react-dev-utils/crossSpawn`:

```
const spawn = require('react-dev-utils/crossSpawn');
```

... which [itself is really a simple file](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-dev-utils/crossSpawn.js) that requires the [`cross-spawn`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-spawn) package, a cross-platform solution to node's `spawn` and `spawnSync` packages:

- https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processspawncommand-args-options
- https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processspawnsynccommand-args-options

Coming back to the actual script, [start is one of the supported scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/9d0369b1fe3260e620b08effcf85f1edefc5d1ea/packages/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js#L27) and `spawn` is used to kick off a new process by requiring the actual start script and caching it as `result` since it's a running process that [watches for termination](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/9d0369b1fe3260e620b08effcf85f1edefc5d1ea/packages/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js#L35):

```js
  const result = spawn.sync(
    process.execPath,
    nodeArgs
      .concat(require.resolve('../scripts/' + script))
      .concat(args.slice(scriptIndex + 1)),
    { stdio: 'inherit' }
  );
```

Going up one directory and finding `scripts/start` gives us [this file](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-scripts/scripts/start.js). Beyond the conditional checks and importing module dependencies, the [part that actually does the set up kicks off in these lines](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/9d0369b1fe3260e620b08effcf85f1edefc5d1ea/packages/react-scripts/scripts/start.js#L75-L78):

```js
// We require that you explicitly set browsers and do not fall back to
// browserslist defaults.
const { checkBrowsers } = require('react-dev-utils/browsersHelper');
checkBrowsers(paths.appPath, isInteractive)
  .then(() => { /* truncated for brevity */ }
```

Here's a high-level overview of what it does after it checks the browsers:

- Choose an available port
- On the available port, determine the configuration (protocol, environment, app name, typescript enablement)
- Prepare the URLs for the application
- Create a webpack compiler that's configured with custom messages
- Load the proxy config
- Serve webpack assets generated by the compiler over a web server
- Launch the webpack dev server and open the browser for the client
- Set up an event listener for possible terminational signals in the future and exit accordingly

Why I stopped here is that, I think the [What's included](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#whats-included) section of its README makes a very important note for all of this magic to work nicely:

> The tradeoff is that these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way. If your project needs more customization, you can "eject" and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.

And before that, an exercise to the reader is given in [this explanation of the problems that Create-React-App addresses and how it attempts to solve them](https://github.com/nitishdayal/cra_closer_look). The repo itself hasn't been updated since 2017, but it would be a good exercise to comb through those details in the year 2021 -- after all, create-react-app is now on [version 4.0.3](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v4.0.3). 😉

## Background

There are two primary ways to style react components

1. Inline styles with the `style` prop
2. Regular CSS with the `className` prop

**About the `style` prop:**

- In HTML you'd pass a string of CSS:

```html
<div style="margin-top: 20px; background-color: blue;"></div>
```

- In React, you'll pass an object of CSS:

```jsx
<div style={{marginTop: 20, backgroundColor: 'blue'}} />
```

Note that in react the `{{` and `}}` is actually a combination of a JSX
expression and an object expression. The same example above could be written
like so:

```jsx
const myStyles = {marginTop: 20, backgroundColor: 'blue'}
<div style={myStyles} />
```

Note also that the property names are `camelCased` rather than `kebab-cased`.
This matches the `style` property of DOM nodes (which is a
[`CSSStyleDeclaration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration)
object).

**About the `className` prop:**

As we discussed earlier, in HTML, you apply a class name to an element with the
`class` attribute. In JSX, you use the `className` prop.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/05.js)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/05.js)

In this exercise we'll use both methods for styling react components.

We have the following css on the page:

```css
.box {
  border: 1px solid #333;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
}
.box--large {
  width: 270px;
  height: 270px;
}
.box--medium {
  width: 180px;
  height: 180px;
}
.box--small {
  width: 90px;
  height: 90px;
}
```

Your job is to apply the right className and style props to the divs so the
styles applied match the text content.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 Create a custom component

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/05.extra-1.js)

Try to make a custom `<Box />` component that renders a div, accepts all the
props and merges the given `style` and `className` props with the shared values.

I should be able to use it like so:

```jsx
<Box className="box--small" style={{backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}}>
  small lightblue box
</Box>
```

The `box` className and `fontStyle: 'italic'` style should be applied in
addition to the values that come from props.

### 2. 💯 accept a size prop to encapsulate styling

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/05.extra-2.js)

It's great that we're composing the `className`s and `style`s properly, but
wouldn't it be better if the users of our components didn't have to worry about
which class name to apply for a given effect? Or that a class name is involved
at all? I think it would be better if users of our component had a `size` prop
and our component took care of making the box that size.

In this extra credit, try to make this API work:

```jsx
<Box size="small" style={{backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}}>
  small lightblue box
</Box>
```
